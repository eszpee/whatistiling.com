							<h1>What is Tiling?</h1>
							<p class="major">“Tiling”, sometimes called “exploring” or “square collecting” is<br /><b>a game about discovering new places</b>. </p>
								<p>Tiles are roughly 1 square mile-sized rectangles* covering the Earth. The goal is to visit as many tiles as possible (which is called “collecting a tile”). To collect a tile, any human-powered means of transportation is acceptable. Most people cycle or hike to collect a tile. </p>

							<p>There are two main categories to compete in: the size of the biggest square in which all tiles are visited, and the number of consecutive tiles that have all four neighbors visited. These categories are often called “<strong>max square</strong>” and “<strong>max cluster</strong>”, respectively. </p>
							
								
								<p><i>*If you’re familiar with Open Street Map, then you might recognize that these are <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Zoom_levels">zoom level</a> 14 tiles.</i></p>

							<h2>What’s the point?</h2>
							<p>Not much, for a lot of people. But the <strong>collecting aspect</strong>, combined with <strong>optimizing routes</strong>, and then going out and <strong>discovering an unknown place</strong> while <strong>doing some exercise</strong> is in the overlapping sweet spot for some. </p>

<p>								<strong>Tiling is really easy to start.</strong> Once you upload your recent Strava rides, you’ll find that there are probably just a few key missing tiles needed to grow your max cluster or square significantly. However, as you progress, these become increasingly hard, and you’ll need to spend more time optimizing your routes to ensure you collect the most tiles per ride. It’s ok to take a train or car to the start point of your trip, but only those tiles count that are collected during a ride or walk.</p>
								
<p>								Some of us do Tiling because we can’t realistically compete in speed, distance, or other classic disciplines, but are still competitive. Others have just moved to a new neighborhood and found Tiling a great way to discover it. Or simply feel bored having to take the same route twice. Or just enjoyed maps since childhood and love a good planning session. There are many reasons — if you feel you check some of these boxes, consider Tiling.</p>

							<h2>How can I start?</h2>
							<p>The easiest way to start is to register a <a href="https://www.strava.com/">Strava</a> account (free tier is sufficient), then sign up for <a href="https://squadrats.com/"><strong>Squadrats</strong></a>, one of the main sites that you can use for Tiling, connect them, and you’re good to go. The terminology on Squadrats is different, they call max square “Übersquadrat”, and max cluster “Yard”. Otherwise, all the rules are as described above. Plan a route to connect a few missing tiles, record your trip with Strava and you should see your covered area growing in Squadrats automatically.</p>
						
							<p>The way to do Tiling for a long time was exclusive to <a href="https://veloviewer.com/"><strong>VeloViewer</strong></a>, where the entire game started. For beginners, the UI of Squadrats is a bit simpler, and in order to have ongoing synchronization of your activities beyond the most recent 25 you need to purchase a PRO subscription for a small £10/year fee. With all the data, analytics, and insights VeloViewer is providing above Strava, it’s a great deal, so consider supporting the site that started Tiling.</p>						</div>

							<h2>How should I plan a route?</h2>

							<p>To maximize the number of tiles collected during a trip, you will need to extend the route planning application to show already captured and still missing tiles. The most versatile solution is the <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/squadrats-route-planning/mkcobabnclhdodfhajlagglahfhkeeon">Squadrats Chrome Extension</a>, which works with all the popular route planners. Once installed, you’ll have an overlay grid and see what tiles will be captured with the route you’re planning.</p>
							
						
							<p>When drawing your route, try to go through road segments that cross three or even four tiles, minimizing the travel needed to bag them. For further trips, consider taking the train instead of a car, which is not just the more environmentally friendly way, but allows you to end your trip in a different place from where you started. Not having to route back to the start often allows you to collect more tiles than otherwise.</p>

							<h2>Who made this site?</h2>
							<p>I’m <a href="https://veloviewer.com/athletes/957793/summary">Péter Szász</a>. I started Tiling in March 2017, when I was looking for a purpose for my cycling hobby. I tried to explain this game numerous times to friends and colleagues, so I figured it was better to just create this page. I recently completed my 40x40 max square, which was an achievement I’ve been working on for years after 35x35, so I wanted to celebrate it with the launch of this page.</p>
